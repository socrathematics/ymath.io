Exponents and logarithms are power-ful tools in mathematics. You should have a base-ic understanding of them if you want to learn topics like calculus.

This course covers a wide range of difficulties, so you may need to skip over the information you already know. Here's a rough guide for where you should start:

* If you're studying pre-algebra, start at the beginning.
* If you're learning algebra 1, you should begin somewhere in the middle of the exponents course.
* If you're in algebra 2, you should go to the logarithms unit.
