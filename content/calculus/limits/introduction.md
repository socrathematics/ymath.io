Limits are the basis for almost everything in calculus. By the time you get to
derivatives, you'll be doing limits and you won't even know it. To become
familiar with what a limit is, let's consider the function

$$
f(x) = \frac{x^2-1}{x-1}. 
$$
What is the value of this function at $x=1$?

$\frac{0}{0}$ is indeterminate, so the function $f(x)$ would be indeterminate at $x=1$. 
However, the function is defined at $x=0.9$ and $x=1.1$: 

$$
f(0.9) = 1.9
$$

$$
f(1.1) = 2.1
$$

In fact, the function is defined for any $x\pm \delta,$ where $\delta \neq 0.$

In this lesson, we'll be considering the case where $\delta$ is very close, but not equal to $0.$
